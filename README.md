# Customer-Database-Analysis

An anaylsis project working with the Classic Models relational database. 

## Queries:

All the data was retrieved from the Classic Models relational database. 

A series of queries extracting information from the customer MySQL database.

## Data Visualization:

To gain better insights on data trends and patterns, data exploration was performed to showcase such relationships in the form of various charts and graphs. This was achieved using Power BI, a popular Business Intelligence (BI) tool as well as Google Colab (very similar to Jupyter Notebook) in Python.

The main rationale for Power BI is that using it requires no prior coding knowledge and it is a highly ubiquitous industry tool. This makes it easy to present data trends and insights to a wide audience (particulairly those with a non-technical background). Power BI can also be highly integrated with other Data Analytics software and tools such as Microsoft SharePoint. All Power BI dashboards can be found in the PowerBI folder in this repository.

With Google Colab, the main benefit is that Python scripts and results obtained can be shared and distributed across multiple parties similar to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc... Also, many popular Machine Learning (ML) libraries and frameworks such as NumPy and TensorFlow are already installed; the user does not need to install anything on their PC.
