# Customer-Database-Analysis

An anaylsis project working with the Classic Models relational database. 

## Queries:

All the data was retrieved from the Classic Models relational database. 

A series of queries extracting information from the customer MySQL database.

## Data Visualization:

To gain better insights on data trends and patterns as well as to understand the relationships between each table, data exploration was performed. This was achieved using Power BI, a popular Business Intelligence (BI) tool as well as Google Colab (very similar to Jupyter Notebook) in Python.

The main rationale with using Power BI is that is requires no prior coding knowledge and it is a highly ubiquitous industry tool. This makes it easy to present data trends and insights to a wide audience (particulairly those with a non-technical background). Power BI can also be highly integrated with other Data Analytics software and tools such as Microsoft SharePoint. More information can be found in the PowerBI folder in this repository.

With Google Colab, the main benefit is that Python scripts and results obtained can be shared and distributed across multiple parties similar to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc...
